# Craigslist-Apartments

This project is aimed at determining a fair market value of a rental listing for an apartment or condo on Craigslist. The project involves building a web scraper for scraping the data for apartment and condo listings from Craigslist. This data is then explored and analyzed by using machine learning algorithms (gradient boosting, kNN).
